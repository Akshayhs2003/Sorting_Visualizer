Sorting Visualizer

A web-based sorting visualizer that allows users to interactively explore and understand various sorting algorithms. The visualizer provides a dynamic representation of sorting algorithms on arrays of different sizes and speeds, offering insights into their time and space complexities.

 Features

- Algorithm Visualization:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- Interactive Controls
  - Adjust array size
  - Control the speed of the algorithm
  - Generate a new random array

- Complexity Information:
  - Display time complexity (worst, average, best case)
  - Display space complexity (worst case)

How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Explore different sorting algorithms and adjust settings using the interactive controls.

Project Structure

- css/:Contains stylesheets for the visualizer.
- scripts/:Includes JavaScript files for sorting algorithms, main logic, and visualizations.
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the visualizer.
